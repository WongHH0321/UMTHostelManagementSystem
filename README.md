<h1>UMT Hostel Management System by Wong Hong Hei, Evangeline Chia Kar Yi, and Lau Yong</h1>

<p>A web-based hostel management system developed mainly to allow the students to choose their preferred room and roommate, thus minimizing the conflicts among roommates and reducing the staff workload as the manual exchange of rooms will be reduced.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Throughout the years, the students at University Malaysia Terengganu complained that
they are not satisfied with the rooms they received as the rooms are assigned to them
at random all these while. There are a few reasons that they are not happy with the
room they are assigned to including having conflicts with their roommates.</p>
<p>Here, we provide a solution that could help minimizing the students' complaints and also the hostel staff workload.</p>
